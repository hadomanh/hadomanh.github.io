### Problem:
> Sim’eon Denis Poisson (1781–1840), a famous French mathematician and physicist, is said to have become interested in mathematics after encountering some version of the following old puzzle: Given an 8-gallon jug full of water and two empty jugs of 5- and 3-gallon capacity, get exactly 4 gallon of water in one of the jugs by completely filling up and/or emptying jugs into others. 
<br>
We will generalize this problem to work with 3 jugs of varying capacity. Let’s say that we have 3 jugs, namely A, B, and C. Jug C will always start out completely full. Furthermore, we will define a goal state where jug A will contain a gallons, B will contain b gallons, and C will contain c gallons upon completion of the search. You need to find the minimum number of moves to go from the initial state to the goal state. 

### Display:
```sh
$ ./waterjugpuzzle
Usage: ./waterjugpuzzle <cap A> <cap B> <cap C> <goal A> <goal B> <goal C>
```

```sh
$ ./waterjugpuzzle 3 5 8 0 2 6
Initial state. (0, 0, 8)
Pour 5 gallons from C to B. (0, 5, 3)
Pour 3 gallons from B to A. (3, 2, 3)
Pour 3 gallons from A to C. (0, 2, 6)
```

```sh
$ ./waterjugpuzzle 5 7 10 3 3 4
No solution.
```

### Solution:
- In this solution, we use **tree** data structure and **BFS** (breadth-first search) to solve the problem. 
- **Root** node is initial state.
- Each **node** in the **tree** corresponds to the state after pouring water and has only **1 parent**
- From each **node**, append maximum of 6 children representing 6 different ways to pour water. 
- When a new state is created, it's marked as visited. We also enqueue it into a **queue**.
- Dequeue each **node** in **queue** and continue to append **tree** from that node.
- When the goal state reached, find the path from **this node** to **root**. The path representing the steps for filling the jugs required by input.

### Example:
Take a look at this example:
```sh
$ ./waterjugpuzzle 3 5 8 0 2 6
Initial state. (0, 0, 8)
Pour 5 gallons from C to B. (0, 5, 3)
Pour 3 gallons from B to A. (3, 2, 3)
Pour 3 gallons from A to C. (0, 2, 6)
```
- Capacity in 3 jugs A, B, C is 3, 5, 8 gallons respectively.
- Our goal is get exactly 2 gallons in jug B and 6 gallons in jug C.
- We start with initial state **(0, 0, 8)**, as **root**, that means
    - Jug A and jub B are empty
    - Jug C contains 8 gallons
- Append 2 children as 2 ways to pour water. We also enqueue them:
```
                Tree                        Queue
                (0, 0, 8)                   |0, 5, 3| <
                /       \                   |3, 0, 5|
               /         \
        (0, 5, 3)       (3, 0, 5)
```
- Dequeue and take **(0, 5, 3)** state. Keep append children from this node and enqueue new states:
```
                            (0, 0, 8)
                            /       \
                           /         \
                   (0, 5, 3)         (3, 0, 5)
                   /       \
                  /         \
          (3, 2, 3)         (3, 5, 0)
```
- Keep going, and we'll have this:
```
                            (0, 0, 8)
                            /       \
                           /         \
                   (0, 5, 3)         (3, 0, 5)
                   /       \                 \
                  /         \                 \
          (3, 2, 3)         (3, 5, 0)         (0, 3, 5)
           /                                  /
          /                                  /
  (0, 2, 6)                          (3, 3, 2)
```
- We can easily see the path from **root** (0, 0, 8) to **goal state** (0, 2, 6). Those are the steps to solve the problem.

### Pseudo code:
```
bool BFS(int a, int b, int c) 

    enqueue new State(a, b, c) 
    dequeue a state from the Queue
    
    while (queue is not empty)
        if current_state equals goal_state
            print the backtracked solution
            return true

        if current_state has already been seen
            continue

        mark current as having been visited
        try 6 ways to pour water, enqueue new states to queue
    
    return false
```
